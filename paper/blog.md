# Who wrote the Book of Mormon? I'm going to let the text answer, and show my work.

*A running post. I add to it as the project moves. Last updated 2026-10-15.*

## Why I'm doing this

Back in 2016 a friend and I wrote a little Java program that pulled the 1830 Book of Mormon,
stemmed the words, counted them, and compared the counts against Joseph Smith's journals. It
was a weekend thing. It never answered anything, and the repo sat there for ten years.

The question didn't go away. Who wrote the English text of the Book of Mormon is one of
those arguments where both sides have run the numbers, both sides got the answer they wanted,
and nobody changed their mind. I think that's a design problem, not a math problem. So I'm
doing it again, in the same repo, with the tools that exist now, and with the rules written
down before I touch the data.

One thing up front: I'm not arguing about whether the book is inspired. That's not a question
a word-counter can answer, and I'm not going to pretend it can. What I can do is ask whether
the English text looks like any specific person's writing, whether it borrows from specific
books, and when its language comes from. If the answer to all three is "we can't tell," that's
a real answer and I'll publish it.

## The three questions

1. **Attribution.** Does the text resemble the writing of Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery,
   Sidney Rigdon, Parley P. Pratt, W. W. Phelps, Solomon Spalding, Ethan Smith, or Gilbert
   Hunt? "None of the above" is always on the table.
2. **Borrowing.** Which earlier books share wording or ideas with it, and is the overlap more
   than you'd expect by chance from two religious books of the same era?
3. **Dating.** Does the grammar look like 1600s English, or like someone in the 1820s
   imitating the King James Bible?

## Why it's still open after 45 years of stylometry

Here's the short version of what's been tried.

- In 1980 three BYU statisticians counted function words and found the book's narrators
  differ from each other and from 19th-century candidates. Critics pointed out their word
  lists were dominated by *unto*, *behold*, and *yea*. That's the King James register, not
  a person.
- In 2008 a Stanford team ran a classifier and got Rigdon and Spalding. But the classifier
  had to pick somebody from the list, and Joseph Smith wasn't on the list.
- In 2011 BYU redid it with a method that allows "nobody on the list" and got a different
  answer.
- In 2013 the Johnsons searched rare four-word phrases across 110,000 old books and found
  *The Late War*, an 1816 schoolbook written in Bible style. The rebuttal: the same score
  rates the Gospel of Luke even higher. Without a baseline for what "unusually similar" looks
  like, the method can't tell a hit from noise.

Here's how bad the register problem is. In the 1830 text, the five-word phrase *it came to
pass that* appears 1,290 times. *And it came to pass* appears 1,169 times. Any method that
doesn't deal with that is measuring the Bible.

Every one of these is a design flaw, and design flaws can be fixed in advance.

## What's different now

Three things exist in 2026 that didn't in 2013.

**Scale.** Harvard released 983,004 public-domain books with cleaned OCR. Add HathiTrust,
the Internet Archive, and old newspapers, and I can compare against most of what was printed
in English between 1780 and 1830, not four hand-picked books.

**A language model that has never read the Book of Mormon.** Every commercial model has
memorized the Book of Mormon and the Bible, so you can't use them to ask "how surprising is
this text." I'm going to train a small model from scratch on 1780-1830 text only, with the
Book of Mormon held out, then fine-tune one copy per candidate author. Then attribution is a
measurable question: which author's model finds the text least surprising? A Dartmouth team
did exactly this in 2025 to confirm who wrote the 15th Oz book. Nobody has done it here.

**Semantic search.** Sentence embeddings can find paraphrase and shared story structure, not
just identical strings.

## The rules I locked myself into

- **The plan is pre-registered.** The hypotheses, methods, and the thresholds that count as
  a match or a non-match are frozen on OSF: https://osf.io/6ugxc/. If I change anything, it's
  a dated public amendment. There's already one, see below.
- **The text is sealed.** The Book of Mormon doesn't touch any model training or tuning until
  the blind run near the end.
- **Everything is validated first.** Every method has to recover known authors from the
  Federalist Papers, from pseudo-biblical books with known authors, and from dictated texts,
  and it has to say "none of the above" when the real author is hidden. Anything that fails
  gets dropped before it ever sees the questioned text.
- **It's me and AI.** No advisors, no second analyst, no journal. I'm honest about that: the
  adversarial review is simulated (I wrote the strongest objections three kinds of scholar
  would raise, then answered them), the blind run is sealed by a script instead of a second
  person, and peer review will be an AI reviewer that only sees the released materials.
  That's a real limit on independence and it's stated everywhere. Anyone who wants to supply
  the missing scrutiny can open a pull request.

Here's what a pre-registered decision rule actually looks like, so you can see this isn't
hand-waving:

> A candidate is *supported* only if at least two independent method families (classical,
> authorial model, embedding) return *match* on both the discovery and confirmation halves.
> H1b holds if no candidate is supported.

## How I work

The whole project is 39 GitHub issues in 8 phases. I pull one, finish it, publish what it
produced, close it, move to the next. The repo is public:
https://github.com/lifehug/book-of-mormon-authorship. The budget is about $500-900 in cash on
top of a Mac mini, because the corpora are free and the models are small on purpose.

That Mac mini thing was a real decision. Training the base model takes 15-25 hours on a
rented H100. On a Mac mini it's three to four weeks. On a $6,800 Mac Studio it's about a
week. So: Mac mini for everything, rent an H100 for about $100 for the one job that needs it.

## What's done so far

### Phase 0: the foundations (BOM-01 to BOM-04)

Reset the repo, wrote the plan, registered it on OSF, wrote and answered the simulated
review, set the budget, opened the accounts. One day.

The simulated review changed the plan in eleven places. The one I'm gladdest about: a null
result for Joseph Smith gets reported as "untestable," not "not a match," because his
undisputed pre-1830 writing is tiny and every method falls apart under about 5,000 words.

### BOM-05: the three earliest texts

There are three witnesses to the earliest English text: the original manuscript Joseph
dictated in 1828-29 (about 28% of it survives), the printer's manuscript Oliver Cowdery copied
from it, and the 1830 Palmyra printing. The Joseph Smith Papers have page-by-page
transcriptions of both manuscripts online, 468 pages and 231 pages. I pulled all of them,
one page every 1.5 seconds, and parsed the 1830 edition into 15 books, 114 chapters, and
1,189 paragraphs.

Then I lined them up. The trick is five-word phrases that occur exactly once in each text.
*Had commanded us and searched* is a good anchor; it appears once in the manuscript and once in
the 1830 text, so it pins those two spots together. *It came to pass that* is useless; it's
in 1,290 places. Chain up all the unique anchors in order and you can map any manuscript
page to the 1830 paragraphs it carries. The printer's manuscript gave 186,331 anchors and all
but 66 of them fell in order.

Here's what the comparison looks like for one paragraph. The 1830 text, 1 Nephi chapter 3,
page 21:

> And now I, Nephi, proceed to give an account upon these plates, of my proceedings, and my
> reign and ministry; therefore, to proceed with mine account. I must speak somewhat of the
> things of my father, and also of my brethren.

The printer's manuscript, page 18, Oliver Cowdery's hand:

> and now i nephi procede to give an account upon these plates of my procedings and my reign
> and ministry wherefore to procede with mine account i must speak somewhat of the things of
> my father and also of my brethren

Four differences: *procede* twice, *procedings*, and *wherefore* became *therefore*. Three of
those are the typesetter fixing Cowdery's spelling. One is a word change. Across the whole
book, 3.5% of words sit in a changed region between the printer's manuscript and the printing,
and most of that is spelling and punctuation.

The original manuscript is a different animal. Here's how its first surviving page opens:

> [ 2 pages not extant ] that [h]e should take his family & depart into the wilderness [& it
> ca]me to pass that he was obediant unto the word of the Lord wherefo[re he] did as the Lord
> commanded him

The brackets are the editors filling in letters the water and mold ate. The alignment found
27.6% of the 1830 paragraphs in what's left of it, which matches Royal Skousen's published
estimate of 28% almost exactly. That's the kind of check that tells me the tool is honest.

The manuscripts also tell you who was holding the pen. Page 161 of the printer's manuscript
carries the note *Oliver Cowdery handwriting ends; scribe 2 begins.* Every aligned paragraph
now has its scribes attached: Cowdery wrote 388 of the 468 printer's pages, an unidentified
"Scribe 2" wrote 80, Hyrum Smith wrote 7. On the original, Cowdery wrote 209 of 231, John
Whitmer 13, a "Scribe 3" 13, and Joseph Smith himself exactly one. That matters later, because
if style shifts track the scribe instead of the narrator, that's a finding.

The transcripts are copyrighted, so they live in a private repo and only their checksums are
public. Anyone can re-fetch them with the script and prove their copy is byte-identical.

| Text | Pages | Aligned | 1830 paragraphs covered | Words changed vs 1830 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Printer's manuscript | 468 | 463 | 99.7% | 3.5% |
| Original manuscript | 231 | 207 | 27.6% | 18.6% (mostly spelling and damage) |

### BOM-06: the Bible that was on the table

The Book of Mormon quotes the King James Bible at length, whole chapters of Isaiah, the
Sermon on the Mount, Malachi. Any authorship test on the raw text would partly be measuring
the 1611 translators. So before anything else I need the exact Bible, verse by verse, to mask
those spans out later.

I used eBible.org's clean digital 1769 text, which is what every American Bible of the 1820s
reprinted, including the Apocrypha, which most digital Bibles leave out. 80 books, 36,822
verses, about 934,000 words. One record per verse looks like this:

```json
{"book": "ISA", "chapter": 48, "verse": 1, "section": "OT",
 "text_marked": "Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, ... [but] not in truth, nor in righteousness."}
```

The brackets mark words the translators supplied; I keep a version with and without them.

Here's why this matters. 1 Nephi chapter 6 in the 1830 printing, page 52:

> Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are
> come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the Lord, and make
> mention of the God of Israel; yet they swear not in truth, nor righteousness.

That's Isaiah 48:1 with about six words changed. A stylometry tool that didn't know this
would credit "the author" with Isaiah's phrasing.

I also grabbed a scan of the actual edition the Smith family bought in October 1829: the
1828 H. & E. Phinney Bible from Cooperstown, New York, with Apocrypha. The OCR is rough. The
same verse comes out as:

> APTER XLVHI. God saveth his people for his own sake. EAR ye this, O house of Jacob, which
> are called i by the ' name of Israel, and are come forth out ' of the waters of Judah ;
> which swear by the name of | the Lord, and make ^ mention of the God of Israel, but not in
> truth nor in righteousness.

You can see the chapter heading, the drop-cap H that OCR lost, and column noise. I'm not
parsing that. I used it for one thing: check that the 1828 printing carries the same 1769
text. Two-thirds of the verses are found verbatim inside that noisy OCR even without caring
about order, evenly across Old Testament, Apocrypha, and New Testament, which is what a
reprint of the same text looks like through a bad scanner.

Small confession: my first version of that check reported 133% of words changed, because a
scanned Bible has two columns and marginal cross-references, and my diff was sweeping the
margins into every verse. Nonsense number, caught it, replaced the measure. The point of
writing this stuff down as I go is that you get to see the wrong turns too.

### BOM-07 and BOM-11, first half: knowing what to download before downloading it

The comparison corpus is the big one, and my MacBook has 130 GB free, so I did the part that
doesn't need disk space. Harvard publishes the catalog of all 983,004 books separately from
the text, as one 300 MB file, no sign-up required. I pulled that and filtered it to English
volumes dated 1780 to 1830:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Volumes | 32,132 |
| Tokens | 10.5 billion |
| Text on disk | about 44 GB |
| Median OCR quality score | 99 out of 100 |
| Flagged as likely duplicates of another volume | 2,768 |

Half what I'd guessed, which is a nice surprise. One catalog row looks like this, and it's a
book that matters for this project:

> `View of the Hebrews; or, The tribes of Israel in America`, Ethan Smith, 1825, 
> about 64,000 tokens, OCR score 99

That's the 1825 second edition of the book people have argued since the 1920s was a source for
the Book of Mormon. Harvard has the 1823 first edition too. Both will be in the corpus without
me hand-picking them, which is the point: the comparison set is everything printed, not the
books one side or the other wants to talk about.

The text itself is gated behind a terms-of-use click (noncommercial, no redistribution), so
the actual 44 GB pull is a one-line command queued for the Mac mini, and the text will never
be in the public repo. Only the catalog and the checksums are.

Same pattern for the early modern set. The Text Creation Partnership keeps 61,315 hand-keyed
transcriptions on GitHub, one repository per book: 53,830 from Early English Books Online
(1473-1700), plus 5,012 early American imprints and 2,473 eighteenth-century texts I hadn't
counted on. The American set alone has 1,982 texts from 1780-1800. I wrote the fetcher,
tested it on three, and the first one it grabbed was the Bay Psalm Book of 1640:

> THE VVHOLE BOOKE OF PSALMES Faithfully TRANSLATED into ENGLISH Metre.

That's the first book printed in British North America, keyed by hand, dropping into my
corpus folder. Those 25 GB are queued for the mini too.

## What's next

Set up the Mac mini, run the two corpus pulls there, then BOM-08 through BOM-10: HathiTrust
(probably skipped if it adds little over Harvard), the Internet Archive, and the Chronicling
America newspapers.
